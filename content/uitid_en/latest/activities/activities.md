An "activity" is an action that the user performs and so shows a particular position with restect to an element in the UDB (event, location, organizer). Currently the following types of activities are supported but on request new types can easily be added:

* list `1`
* detail `2`
* like `3`
* mail `4`
* print `5`
* facebook `6`
* twitter `7`
* ik ga `8` (i'm going)
* ticket `9`
* route `10`
* moreinfo `11`
* uitpas checkin `12`
* gewone checkin `13` (ordinary checkin)
* comment `14`
* recommend `15`
* page member `16`
* page admin `17`
* page follow `18`
* new event `19`

All these activities are posted to a recommendation engine and on this basis the user will get recommendations. The engine supports several algorithms.

Activities can be forwarded as public or private and the user can customize the privacy setting.

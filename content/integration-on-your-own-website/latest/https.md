# Solutions for encrypted websites

You can also use the UiT widgets on encrypted websites via HTTPS (SSL).

When pasting the code of your project, you change the http: // in the script tag by https: //
so
~~~
<script type="text/javascript" src="http://tools.uitdatabank.be/widgets/layout/****.js"></script>
~~~

becomes

~~~
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://tools.uitdatabank.be/widgets/layout/****.js"></script>
~~~

After this change, the widgets must be republished. You can do this yourself by resaving your widgets configuration or by reporting to
<a href="mailto:vragen@uitdatabank.be">vragen@uitdatabank.be</a>.
